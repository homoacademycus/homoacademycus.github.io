# Symtom
1. installed create-react-app as global module
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

2. removed node_modules directory in project
```
rm -rf node_modules
```

3. tried to reinstall node_modules in project with package.json
```
npm install
```

4. node_modules directory is not appeared!!

# Cause
```
If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

from https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
```

# Solution
1. uninstall globally installed CRA
```
npm uninstall -g create-react-app
```

2. install CRA as local package
```
npm install create-react-app
```
